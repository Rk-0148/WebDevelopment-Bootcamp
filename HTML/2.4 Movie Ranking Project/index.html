    <h1>The Best Movies According to Rohan</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
    <p>
      The film is all about an eight year old boy named Ishaan Awasti whose
      world is filled with wonders that no one else seems to appreciate such as
      colors, stars,fish ,flowers and others animals belongs to nature are just
      not important in the world of adults in our society,who are much more
      interested in things like homework daily assignment are exam also Marks. I
      have watched this film in several times .Whenever I watched this movie i
      cried from core of my heart. Ishaan ,a kind of student who suffers from a
      disease called dyslexia .Due to dyslexia ishaan cannot seem to get
      anything right at this school as well as later on boarding school.So as
      results of this disease ishaan cannot perform well in academics.Whereas
      his elder brother is excellent in academics.When he gets into more
      problems then his parents can handle ,he is packed off to a new boarding
      school to become disciplined. Soon a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumph
      ,helps ishaan to discover his hidden talents .And after some time his
      patience, affection are care recovered ishaan from the disease. He
      ultimately helps ishaan to become completely fine .And finally ishaan
      belongs to a completely new life just like another eight to nine year's
      child.

    <h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
    <p>
      Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the
      end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the
      last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller
      coaster and throughout its run time brings about fascination, humor,
      sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your
      typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop
      action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that
      this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations.
